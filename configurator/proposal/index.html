	<h2>Project Goal</h2>
	<p>I am going to design a Starbucks configurator used to customize Starbucks drinks. <br>The final deliverable is going to be a mobile version with interactions (not only images). <br>The must-have drinks in the deliverable are going to be coffee. <br>If time permits, I will add a configurator for customized frappuccino as well.</p><br>
